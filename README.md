# The-Gift

To my best friend's birthday anniversary, so we have this. The Astronaut will bring you a little gift.

---
**HOW IT WORKS:**
* Run `astronaut.py` in **Terninal/CMD**, after a few second the Astronaut has walked, on screen you will see:
> Happy Birthday

If you want to change the text, access to the `astronaut.py` and suft to the last line of the file.
There are `run_cores` function, and it takes a string as parameter. Just add more or change the `run_cores` function to display a new word.
